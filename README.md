Playing Card CSS: http://selfthinker.github.com/CSS-Playing-Cards/

I was doing this code as an exercise for a company. As I am still looking for work, going to commit the code to the github so companies can see that I am not complete tool. Even though I propably am..

"The purpose of this exercise is to see how you model the various concepts of the game inside the application and how you design your code."

I think the code demonstrates that I am able to do modular Javascript and pay great attention to a design. Basically the Game is designed so
that it can be extended to multiple players and multiple tables.

for testing use karma plugin for Idea.

The game is not complete, but from the code you can see that it would be fairly easy to complete. I am moving to do other interview tests now.

BR,

Sakari
